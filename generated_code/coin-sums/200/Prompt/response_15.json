This approach involves using the largest denomination coin first, then moving to smaller denominations as needed.\n\nHere's an implementation of the `my_func` function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    input1 %= 5\n    pennies = input1\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function calculates the number of quarters first, then dimes, nickels, and finally pennies, using integer division and modulus operations to update the remaining amount after each step. The function returns four integers representing the count of each type of coin needed to make the specified amount in cents."}
