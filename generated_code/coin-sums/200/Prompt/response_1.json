Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "Here's a Python function that calculates the fewest number of US coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters) needed to make a given amount of cents, and returns the number of each type of coin.\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    input1 %= 5\n    pennies = input1\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer input `input1`, which represents the number of cents. It calculates the number of quarters first, followed by dimes, nickels, and finally pennies, using integer division and the modulus operator to update the remaining amount. The function returns a tuple containing the number of each type of coin."}
