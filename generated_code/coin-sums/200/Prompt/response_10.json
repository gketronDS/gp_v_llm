Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    # Define the value of each type of coin in cents\n    quarters = 25\n    dimes = 10\n    nickels = 5\n    pennies = 1\n\n    # Calculate the number of quarters\n    num_quarters = input1 // quarters\n    input1 %= quarters\n\n    # Calculate the number of dimes\n    num_dimes = input1 // dimes\n    input1 %= dimes\n\n    # Calculate the number of nickels\n    num_nickels = input1 // nickels\n    input1 %= nickels\n\n    # Calculate the number of pennies\n    num_pennies = input1 // pennies\n\n    # Return the result as four separate integers\n    return num_quarters, num_dimes, num_nickels, num_pennies\n```\n\nThis function calculates the maximum number of quarters that can be used, then the maximum number of dimes, nickels, and finally pennies, by continuously updating the remaining amount to be converted. Each type of coin is calculated using integer division (`//`) and the remainder is updated using the modulus operator (`%`). The function returns four integers representing the count of each type of coin."}
