The function should output 4 integers.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "Certainly! Below is the Python function `my_func`, which takes an integer input representing the number of cents and returns the fewest number of US coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) needed to make that amount:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    input1 %= 5\n    pennies = input1\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function performs the following operations to calculate the number of each type of coin:\n1. It calculates the number of quarters by performing integer division of the input by 25.\n2. It updates the input to the remainder after quarters are taken out.\n3. It calculates the number of dimes by performing integer division of the updated input by 10.\n4. It updates the input to the remainder after dimes are taken out.\n5. It calculates the number of nickels by performing integer division of the updated input by 5.\n6. It updates the input to the remainder after nickels are taken out.\n7. The remainder of the input is the number of pennies.\n8. It returns the count of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies as a tuple."}
