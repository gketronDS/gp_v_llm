The coins available are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents). Here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    input1 %= 5\n    pennies = input1\n    \n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It calculates how many quarters can be used by performing integer division of the input by 25. It then updates the input to be the remainder after quarters are used.\n2. It calculates how many dimes can be used by performing integer division of the updated input by 10. It updates the input to be the remainder after dimes are used.\n3. It calculates how many nickels can be used by performing integer division of the updated input by 5. It updates the input to be the remainder after nickels are used.\n4. Finally, whatever is left will be the number of pennies needed.\n\nThe function returns the number of each coin type required."}
