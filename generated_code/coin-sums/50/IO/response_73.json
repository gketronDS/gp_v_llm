By analyzing the examples, we can identify a pattern or a set of rules that govern the transformation process.\n\nLet's break down the examples provided to determine the pattern:\n\n1. **Divisibility and Modulus Operations:** We may be dealing with a series of operations involving division and modulus with specific numbers to extract each of the four integers.\n2. **Range of Inputs:** The input is always an integer between 1 and 10,000, which suggests that the transformations should work within this range.\n\nUpon examining the examples, it seems that the transformation involves:\n- Dividing by a number, likely to determine 'hundreds' or 'thousands.'\n- Modulus operations to determine remainders which may help derive the other integers.\n\nWe observe that:\n- The first integer seems related to the number of times the input can be divided by a number like 4.\n- The second integer might be derived from some modulo operation.\n- The third integer also seems to follow a similar pattern, possibly connected to division or modulus.\n- The fourth integer seems to be a division by a fixed number (e.g., 25) of the input or its remainder.\n\nHere's the function that replicates the transformation process:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    a = input1 // 2500\n    b = (input1 % 2500) // 1000\n    c = (input1 % 1000) // 500\n    d = (input1 % 500) // 25\n    return a, b, c, d\n```\n\nThis function uses division and modulus operations to break down the input integer into four parts, following the observed examples. Each part is derived by dividing or taking the modulus of the input with the respective divisor."}
