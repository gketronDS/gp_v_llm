Let's break down the examples to understand the logic:\n\n1. The output consists of four integers.\n2. The examples suggest that these integers are derived from some operations on the input integer.\n\nBy examining the examples, we notice that:\n- The first integer appears to be influenced by the input's divisibility by certain numbers.\n- The second integer might be related to a different set of conditions.\n- The third and fourth integers also follow specific rules based on the input.\n\nUpon analyzing the examples, we can propose a hypothesis for each component of the output:\n\n1. The first integer seems to be related to how the input is divisible by 4.\n2. The second integer might correspond to the remainder when dividing by 5.\n3. The third integer appears to be related to the input's behavior when divided by 3.\n4. The fourth integer seems to be related to the input when divided by a larger number, possibly 25.\n\nGiven these observations, let's create the function `my_func` to reflect these rules:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1:int):\n    first_component = (input1 % 4) + 1 if input1 % 4 != 0 else 4\n    second_component = (input1 % 5) // 4\n    third_component = 1 if input1 % 3 == 0 else (input1 % 3) // 2\n    fourth_component = input1 // 25\n    return first_component, second_component, third_component, fourth_component\n```\n\nThis function is derived from interpreting the pattern in the examples provided. If the pattern is more complex, additional rules may need to be applied, but this should cover the majority of cases based on the given examples."}
