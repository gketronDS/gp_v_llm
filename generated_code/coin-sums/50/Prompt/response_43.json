The function should output 4 integers.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "To solve this problem, you'll need to calculate the minimum number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) needed to make up the given amount of cents. Here's how you can modify the `my_func` to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    input1 %= 5\n    pennies = input1\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer input representing the number of cents and returns four integers: the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed to make that amount. The function uses integer division and the modulus operator to determine the number of each type of coin required."}
