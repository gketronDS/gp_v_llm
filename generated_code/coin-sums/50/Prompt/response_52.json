Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "To solve this problem, you need a function that will convert the input amount of cents into the fewest number of US coins, specifically quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent). Here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 = input1 % 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 = input1 % 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    pennies = input1 % 5\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function works by:\n\n1. Calculating the number of quarters and updating the remaining cents.\n2. Calculating the number of dimes from the remaining cents.\n3. Calculating the number of nickels from the remaining cents.\n4. The remaining cents are all pennies.\n\nThe function returns four integers corresponding to the number of each type of coin."}
