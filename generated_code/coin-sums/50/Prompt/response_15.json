Here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    input1 %= 5\n    pennies = input1\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function first calculates how many quarters are needed, then updates the remaining amount of cents. It proceeds similarly for dimes, nickels, and finally pennies. The function ultimately returns the number of each type of coin required."}
