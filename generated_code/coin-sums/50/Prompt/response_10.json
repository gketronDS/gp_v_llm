This approach involves using the largest denomination possible first, and then moving down to smaller denominations. Here's how you can modify the function `my_func`:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    input1 %= 5\n    pennies = input1\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer input representing the number of cents and returns a tuple containing the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed to make that amount. It uses integer division (`//`) to determine the number of each coin type and the modulus operator (`%`) to update the remaining amount after each step."}
