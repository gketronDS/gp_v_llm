The function outputs four integers: the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int):\n    quarters = input1 // 25\n    input1 %= 25\n    dimes = input1 // 10\n    input1 %= 10\n    nickels = input1 // 5\n    pennies = input1 % 5\n    return quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies\n```\n\nThis function calculates how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed by repeatedly dividing the remaining amount by the value of each coin and using the modulus operator to find the remainder. It then returns the counts of each type of coin."}
