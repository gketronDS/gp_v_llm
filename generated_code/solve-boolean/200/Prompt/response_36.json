The function should output a Boolean.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "```python\ndef my_func(input1: str) -> bool:\n    input1 = input1.replace('t', 'True').replace('f', 'False')\n    return eval(input1)\n```\n\nThis function will evaluate a string containing the characters 't', 'f', '|', and '&', replacing 't' and 'f' with their Boolean equivalents, and using Python's logical operators to evaluate the expression. It will then return the resulting Boolean value. Note that `eval` is used here to evaluate the expression, which is acceptable in this context given the constraints and input assumptions."}
