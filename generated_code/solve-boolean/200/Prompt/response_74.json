{"submission": "```python\nGiven a string representing a Boolean expression consisting of T F  and  evaluate it and return the resulting Boolean\ndef my_func(input1:str):\n            \"\"\"Alter this python function \"my_func\" to accept inputs containing             a string of length [1, 20] made of characters from {t, f, |, &}. The function should output a Boolean.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "To accomplish this, you can modify the `my_func` function to evaluate the Boolean expression using Python's built-in capabilities. Here's an implementation that adheres to the constraints:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str) -> bool:\n    input1 = input1.replace('t', 'True').replace('f', 'False')\n    return eval(input1)\n```\n\nThis function replaces the characters 't' and 'f' with 'True' and 'False', respectively, and then evaluates the expression using `eval()`. Note that `eval()` is used here because it's part of base Python and allows for the evaluation of a string as a Python expression, which fits the requirements."}
