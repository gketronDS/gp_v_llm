{"submission": "```python\nGiven a string representing a Boolean expression consisting of T F  and  evaluate it and return the resulting Boolean\ndef my_func(input1:str):\n            \"\"\"Alter this python function \"my_func\" to accept inputs containing             a string of length [1, 20] made of characters from {t, f, |, &}. The function should output a Boolean.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "Here's a modified version of the function that evaluates a Boolean expression consisting of the characters `t`, `f`, `|`, and `&`. The function assumes that `t` represents `True`, `f` represents `False`, `|` represents the logical OR operation, and `&` represents the logical AND operation.\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str):\n    result = input1[0] == 't'\n    for i in range(1, len(input1), 2):\n        operator = input1[i]\n        value = input1[i + 1] == 't'\n        if operator == '|':\n            result = result or value\n        elif operator == '&':\n            result = result and value\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function processes the input string by evaluating the expression from left to right. It initializes the result with the Boolean value of the first character and then iteratively applies the logical operations as indicated by the subsequent characters in the string."}
