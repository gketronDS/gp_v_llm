The function should output a Boolean.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.

Here's a Python function that performs this task:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str) -> bool:\n    # Initialize a stack to hold boolean values\n    stack = []\n\n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input1:\n        if char == 't':\n            stack.append(True)\n        elif char == 'f':\n            stack.append(False)\n        elif char == '|':\n            b1 = stack.pop()\n            b2 = stack.pop()\n            stack.append(b2 or b1)\n        elif char == '&':\n            b1 = stack.pop()\n            b2 = stack.pop()\n            stack.append(b2 and b1)\n    \n    return stack.pop() if stack else False\n\n# Example usage:\n# result = my_func(\"t&t|f\")\n# This should evaluate to True because (True AND True) OR False is True.\n```\n\nThis function uses a stack to evaluate the expression. It processes each character of the input string and applies the respective logical operations. The result is stored back in the stack, and once all operations are complete, the final result is returned."}
