We need to calculate the bounciness index and then compute the total distance the ball travels across the specified number of bounces.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: float, input2: float, input3: int) -> float:\n    if not (1.0 <= input1 <= 100.0) or not (1.0 <= input2 <= 100.0) or not (1 <= input3 <= 20):\n        return 0.0\n    \n    bounciness_index = input2 / input1\n    total_distance = input1\n    \n    for _ in range(input3):\n        total_distance += input1 * bounciness_index\n        input1 *= bounciness_index\n    \n    return total_distance\n```\n\nHere's what the function does:\n\n1. It checks if `input1` and `input2` are within the range [1.0, 100.0] and if `input3` is within the range [1, 20]. If any input is out of range, it returns 0.0.\n   \n2. It calculates the bounciness index as the ratio of the height after the first bounce (`input2`) to the starting height (`input1`).\n\n3. It initializes `total_distance` with the starting height since the ball travels this distance initially when dropped.\n\n4. It iterates over the number of bounces specified by `input3`, adding the distance of each bounce to `total_distance` and updating the height for the next bounce using the bounciness index.\n\n5. Finally, it returns the total distance traveled by the ball."}
