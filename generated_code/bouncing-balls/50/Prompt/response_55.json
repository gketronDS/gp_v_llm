The function should accept three inputs:\n   - `input1`: A float representing the starting height of a dropped ball, constrained between 1.0 and 100.0.\n   - `input2`: A float representing the height after the first bounce, constrained between 1.0 and 100.0.\n   - `input3`: An integer representing the number of bounces to calculate the total travel distance, constrained between 1 and 20.\n\n2. Calculate the bounciness index, which is the ratio of the height after the first bounce to the starting height.\n\n3. Use the bounciness index to calculate the total distance the ball travels over the specified number of bounces.\n\nHere is the modified function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: float, input2: float, input3: int) -> float:\n    if not (1.0 <= input1 <= 100.0) or not (1.0 <= input2 <= 100.0) or not (1 <= input3 <= 20):\n        return 0.0\n    \n    bounciness_index = input2 / input1\n    total_distance = input1\n    current_height = input2\n\n    for _ in range(1, input3):\n        total_distance += 2 * current_height\n        current_height *= bounciness_index\n\n    return total_distance\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the inputs are within the specified ranges; if not, it returns `0.0`. It then calculates the bounciness index, initializes the total distance with the starting height, and iteratively adds the distance traveled during each bounce. The loop starts from the second bounce since the first bounce is handled separately. Finally, it returns the total distance traveled."}
