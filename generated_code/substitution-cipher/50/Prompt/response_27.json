Here's the implementation of the `my_func` function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    # Create a mapping dictionary from input1 to input2\n    cipher_map = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    \n    # Decipher the input3 string using the mapping dictionary\n    deciphered_message = ''.join(cipher_map.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n    \n    return deciphered_message\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Creation**: We create a dictionary `cipher_map` that maps each character from `input1` to the corresponding character in `input2`. This is done using a dictionary comprehension.\n\n2. **Deciphering**: We iterate over each character in `input3` and replace it using the `cipher_map`. If a character in `input3` doesn't exist in `cipher_map` (i.e., it wasn't mapped in `input1`), it remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the deciphered message as a string.\n\nThe function adheres to the constraints and uses only base Python functions without any imports."}
