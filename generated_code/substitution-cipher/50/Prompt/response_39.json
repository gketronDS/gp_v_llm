{"submission": "```python\nThis problem gives 3 strings The first two represent a cipher mapping each character in one string to the one at the same index in the other string The program must apply this cipher to the third string and return the deciphered message\ndef my_func(input1:str, input2:str, input3:str):\n            \"\"\"Alter this python function \"my_func\" to accept inputs containing             3 strings of length [0, 26]. The function should output a string.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to create a function that uses the first two strings to define a cipher mapping and then applies this mapping to transform the third string. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    mapping = {k: v for k, v in zip(input1, input2)}\n    return ''.join(mapping.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We create a `mapping` dictionary using a dictionary comprehension that pairs each character in `input1` with the corresponding character in `input2`.\n- We then transform `input3` by replacing each character with its mapped value from the dictionary if it exists; otherwise, we keep the character as it is.\n- The `join` function is used to concatenate the transformed characters into the final output string."}
