Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "To solve this problem, we'll implement a function `my_func` that takes three strings as input. The first two strings represent a cipher mapping, where each character in the first string maps to the corresponding character in the second string. The function will apply this mapping to the third string and return the deciphered message.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    mapping = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    return ''.join(mapping.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It creates a dictionary called `mapping` that maps each character in `input1` to the corresponding character in `input2`.\n2. It then processes each character in `input3`, replacing it with its mapped character if it exists in `mapping`. If a character doesn't exist in the mapping (meaning it wasn't in `input1`), it remains unchanged.\n3. The function returns the resulting string after applying the mapping."}
