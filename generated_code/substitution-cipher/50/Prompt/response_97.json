Here's the implementation for the function `my_func`:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    # Create a dictionary to map characters from input1 to input2\n    cipher_map = {char1: char2 for char1, char2 in zip(input1, input2)}\n    \n    # Decipher input3 using the cipher_map\n    result = ''.join(cipher_map.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Mapping Creation**: \n   - We use a dictionary comprehension to create a mapping (`cipher_map`) where each character in `input1` maps to the corresponding character in `input2`. We use the `zip` function to pair characters from `input1` and `input2`.\n\n2. **Deciphering Process**:\n   - We iterate over each character in `input3`, and for each character, we use the `cipher_map` to find its corresponding mapped character. If the character is not present in the `cipher_map`, it remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Result Construction**:\n   - We use `join` to concatenate the deciphered characters into a single string.\n\nBy using this approach, we ensure the function adheres to the problem's constraints and efficiently deciphers `input3` based on the provided cipher mapping."}
