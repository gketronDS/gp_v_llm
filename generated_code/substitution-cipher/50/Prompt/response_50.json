{"submission": "```python\nThis problem gives 3 strings The first two represent a cipher mapping each character in one string to the one at the same index in the other string The program must apply this cipher to the third string and return the deciphered message\ndef my_func(input1:str, input2:str, input3:str):\n            \"\"\"Alter this python function \"my_func\" to accept inputs containing             3 strings of length [0, 26]. The function should output a string.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "To solve the problem, we'll need to create a mapping between characters from `input1` and `input2`, and then use this mapping to transform the characters in `input3`. Here's the modified function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    mapping = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    return ''.join(mapping.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Mapping Creation**: We use a dictionary comprehension to create a mapping where each character in `input1` maps to the corresponding character in `input2`.\n\n2. **Deciphering the Message**: We iterate over each character in `input3` and use the mapping to transform it. If a character in `input3` is found in the mapping, it's replaced with the mapped character; otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Output**: The transformed characters are joined into a single string, which is returned as the output."}
