The first two strings represent a cipher mapping, where each character in the first string maps to the character at the same index in the second string. The third string is the one you need to decipher using this mapping. Here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    # Create a dictionary to store the cipher mapping\n    cipher_map = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    \n    # Decipher the third string using the cipher map\n    deciphered_message = ''.join(cipher_map.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n    \n    return deciphered_message\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Cipher Mapping:** The function starts by creating a dictionary (`cipher_map`) where each key-value pair corresponds to a character from `input1` mapping to a character in `input2`.\n\n2. **Deciphering Process:** The function then processes each character in `input3`. For each character, it checks if there's a corresponding mapped character in `cipher_map`. If there is, it uses the mapped character; otherwise, it keeps the original character (using `char` as a default in `cipher_map.get()`).\n\n3. **Return Result:** Finally, the function returns the deciphered message as a single string, which is constructed by joining all the processed characters.\n\nThis function assumes all three strings are valid and of appropriate lengths (0 to 26), and it handles cases where characters in `input3` are not found in `input1` by leaving them unchanged."}
