Let's create the function `my_func` to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    # Create a dictionary to store the mapping from input1 to input2\n    cipher_map = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    \n    # Apply the cipher map to input3\n    result = ''.join(cipher_map.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Cipher Mapping Creation**:\n   - We create a dictionary `cipher_map` using a dictionary comprehension.\n   - Each character in `input1` is mapped to the corresponding character in `input2`.\n\n2. **Deciphering `input3`**:\n   - We iterate over each character in `input3`.\n   - For each character, we use the `cipher_map` to find its mapped character.\n   - If a character in `input3` is not in `cipher_map` (i.e., not present in `input1`), it remains unchanged.\n   - The `join` function compiles the transformed characters into a single string.\n\nThis function meets the problem requirements by using only base Python functions and adhering to the constraints given in the prompt."}
