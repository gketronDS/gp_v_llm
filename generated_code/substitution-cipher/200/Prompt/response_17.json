Here's how the function can be implemented:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    cipher_map = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    return ''.join(cipher_map.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Cipher Mapping Creation**:\n   - We use a dictionary comprehension to create a `cipher_map` where each character in `input1` maps to the corresponding character in `input2`. This is done by iterating over the indices of the strings.\n\n2. **Deciphering the Third String**:\n   - We iterate over each character in `input3`.\n   - For each character, we use the `get` method of the dictionary to find its corresponding mapped character. If the character is not in the `cipher_map`, we return the character itself (i.e., no substitution occurs).\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - We join all the substituted characters into a single string using `''.join()`, which is returned by the function.\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles cases where characters in `input3` do not have a corresponding mapping in the `cipher_map`."}
