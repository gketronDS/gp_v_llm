{"submission": "```python\nThis problem gives 3 strings The first two represent a cipher mapping each character in one string to the one at the same index in the other string The program must apply this cipher to the third string and return the deciphered message\ndef my_func(input1:str, input2:str, input3:str):\n            \"\"\"Alter this python function \"my_func\" to accept inputs containing             3 strings of length [0, 26]. The function should output a string.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "Here's an implementation of the function `my_func` that applies the cipher mapping from two input strings to decipher a third string:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    mapping = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    return ''.join(mapping.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n```\n\nThis function creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `input1` maps to the corresponding character in `input2`. It then processes `input3`, replacing each character using the dictionary and returns the resulting deciphered string. Characters not found in the mapping are left unchanged."}
