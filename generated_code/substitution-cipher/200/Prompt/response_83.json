Here's how we can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    # Create a dictionary mapping each character in input1 to the corresponding character in input2\n    cipher_map = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    \n    # Use the cipher map to transform the input3 string\n    deciphered_message = ''.join(cipher_map.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n    \n    return deciphered_message\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Cipher Mapping**: We create a dictionary (`cipher_map`) where each character in `input1` is a key, and the corresponding character in `input2` is the value.\n\n2. **Transformation**: We iterate over each character in `input3`. For each character, we look it up in the `cipher_map`. If the character is found, we replace it with the mapped value; if it's not found (meaning there's no mapping for it), we leave it unchanged.\n\n3. **Return**: We construct the resulting deciphered string by joining all transformed characters together and return it.\n\nThis solution uses only base Python functions and adheres to the constraints given in the problem statement."}
