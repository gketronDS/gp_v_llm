{"submission": "```python\nThis problem gives 3 strings The first two represent a cipher mapping each character in one string to the one at the same index in the other string The program must apply this cipher to the third string and return the deciphered message\ndef my_func(input1:str, input2:str, input3:str):\n            \"\"\"Alter this python function \"my_func\" to accept inputs containing             3 strings of length [0, 26]. The function should output a string.            Only use base python functions and do not import any packages.            Do not include print statements, unit tests, in-line comments or            multi-line comments.\"\"\"```", "response": "To implement this function, you need to create a mapping between the characters of `input1` and `input2`, and use this mapping to decode `input3`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str, input3: str) -> str:\n    cipher_map = {input1[i]: input2[i] for i in range(len(input1))}\n    return ''.join(cipher_map.get(char, char) for char in input3)\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a dictionary `cipher_map` where each character in `input1` maps to the corresponding character in `input2`. Then, it iterates over each character in `input3`, using the map to translate each character to its counterpart in `input2`. If a character in `input3` does not exist in `input1`, it remains unchanged. The result is concatenated into a single string and returned."}
