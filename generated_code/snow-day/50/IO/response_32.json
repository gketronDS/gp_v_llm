Let's analyze the examples to deduce a pattern or formula:\n\n1. **Observations and Formula Deduction:**\n   - The function takes four inputs: an integer and three floats.\n   - The output seems to be a float derived from these four inputs.\n\n2. **Patterns:**\n   - If the last input (input4) is 0, the output seems to be a combination of other inputs.\n   - If the last input is close to 1, the output might be significantly reduced.\n   - The function seems to involve a combination of multiplication and addition of inputs, possibly with some conditional logic.\n\n3. **Hypothesis:**\n   - The function seems to follow a pattern such as combining the inputs in a specific formula involving multiplication and division that affects the final result. We can hypothesize that the function might use the inputs as weights or coefficients to adjust the number.\n   - It might involve scaling the result by some factor derived from input4.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - Let's implement a function based on potential hypotheses derived from patterns in the examples.\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input1 * input2 + input3\n    elif input4 == 1:\n        return input1 * input3 - input2\n    else:\n        return (input1 * input2 + input3) / (1 + input4)\n```\n\n5. **Explanation:**\n   - This function captures some of the potential logic deduced from the examples:\n     - If `input4` is 0, the function seems to directly compute a weighted sum of `input1` and `input2`, adding `input3`.\n     - If `input4` is 1, it applies a different logic, possibly subtracting `input2` from a weighted product.\n     - If `input4` is between 0 and 1, it divides the weighted sum by `(1 + input4)`, possibly to scale it down.\n\nThis function is a hypothesis based on the given examples and might not cover all edge cases, but it should provide a starting point for capturing the mechanism demonstrated in the examples."}
