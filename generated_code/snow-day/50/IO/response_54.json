Let's attempt to derive this by examining the input-output pairs.\n\n1. **General Observations:**\n   - For some cases, the function output is equal to the second input when the first input is 0 (e.g., `my_func(0,9.525449909870826,5.65252151757635,0.2113661673440117) == 9.525449909870826`).\n   - When the third and fourth inputs are zero, the output is often equal to the second input (e.g., `my_func(15,14.56,0.0,0.0) == 14.56`).\n   - The first input seems to have a significant impact on the output when other inputs are non-zero.\n\n2. **Pattern Derivation:**\n   - When `input1` is high (close to 20), the result seems to be significantly influenced by the values of `input2`, `input3`, and `input4`.\n   - When `input1` is lower, the influence of `input2` and `input3` seems more pronounced.\n   - There is a substantial non-linear behavior, possibly involving multiplication, division, or some polynomial relation with the inputs.\n\n3. **Hypothesized Formula:**\n\n   Based on analyzing the examples, a potential formula that fits most cases appears to involve:\n   - A weighted combination of inputs.\n   - The use of multiplication and division involving `input3` and `input4`.\n   - Adjustments with specific constants to match the output in given examples.\n\nHere's one possible implementation that fits the examples:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input1 == 0:\n        return input2\n    result = input2 * (1 + input4) + input3 * input4 * input1\n    if input3 > 5:\n        result += input1 * input3 * input4\n    if input4 > 0.5:\n        result *= 0.5\n    elif input4 > 0:\n        result *= (1 - input4)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function attempts to closely match the examples provided by adjusting the influence of each input. Note that the exact logic may require further tweaking to perfectly match all cases, as some outputs might involve other undisclosed transformations or conditions. Adjustments can be made by further analyzing the relationships and testing additional scenarios."}
