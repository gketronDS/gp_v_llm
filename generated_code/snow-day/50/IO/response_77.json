To achieve this, we can analyze the provided examples and look for patterns. Let's summarize the key observations:\n\n1. **Observation of Inputs and Outputs:**\n    - The output seems to change based on combinations of the inputs, which are an integer and three floats.\n    - The integer ranges from 0 to 20, while the floats have specific ranges as mentioned in the prompt.\n\n2. **Potential Operations:**\n    - The output might involve arithmetic operations with the inputs, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n    - It might involve conditional logic based on the magnitude or range of inputs.\n\n3. **Analysis of Examples:**\n    - The first few examples suggest that the result could be heavily influenced by the multiplication of some inputs since the outputs vary significantly in magnitude.\n    - There's a possibility of division, as the outputs are sometimes less than any of the individual inputs.\n    - The effect of `input4` (the float in [0.0, 1.0]) seems to be significant in reducing the magnitude of the output in some cases.\n\n4. **Trial and Error:**\n    - By experimenting with different combinations of arithmetic operations, we can try to mimic the behavior of the given examples.\n\nGiven the complexity of deriving the exact formula from observations, let's propose a potential solution that attempts to replicate the examples:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float):\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input2 if input1 == 0 else input1 * input2 + input3\n    factor = input1 * (1 - input4)\n    return (input2 * factor + input3) / (1 + input4 * input3)\n```\n\nThis function attempts to:\n- Directly return `input2` when `input4` is zero and `input1` is zero.\n- Use a combination of multiplication and division to adjust the influence of `input3` and `input4` on the result.\n- Adjust the contribution of `input1` and `input2` based on the value of `input4`.\n\nPlease note that this is a best-effort approximation based on the examples provided, and without further constraints or patterns, this might not perfectly match all cases."}
