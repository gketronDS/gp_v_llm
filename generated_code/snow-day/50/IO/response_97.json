The function takes four inputs: an integer `input1` and three floats `input2`, `input3`, and `input4`. The goal is to identify a consistent way to calculate the output based on these inputs.\n\nLet's analyze some of the provided examples to deduce the pattern:\n\n1. **Example:**\n   - Inputs: `(6, 14.224637393426914, 8.272651027052694, 0.066878743280863)`\n   - Output: `51.4309227302435`\n   \n2. **Example:**\n   - Inputs: `(15, 4.444175815572717, 4.0457303254893535, 0.1922195932384932)`\n   - Output: `20.371989857535524`\n\nBy closely examining the examples, one possible pattern emerges where the function's output seems to involve a combination of the inputs, possibly involving multiplication, addition, or some other operations. Let's try to create a formula that fits these examples:\n\n- It seems like the output is generated by a weighted sum or combination of the inputs.\n- The fourth input, `input4`, might be acting as a weight or modifier for the other inputs.\n\nBased on this, let's try to formulate a function:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input1 * input2 + input3\n    elif input1 == 0:\n        return input2\n    else:\n        return (input1 * input2) / (1 + input3 * input4)\n```\n\nThis function is designed to match the provided examples as closely as possible based on the analysis of the given outputs. The function uses conditional logic to handle cases where `input4` is zero or `input1` is zero, as observed in the examples. The general formula attempts to use a combination of multiplication and division to fit the pattern seen in the outputs."}
