This can be quite challenging, as the function's logic isn't explicitly provided, and the examples seem to follow a complex pattern. However, by examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the underlying mechanism.\n\nHere's an analysis approach to determine the function logic:\n\n1. **Analyze the Examples**: Look for patterns or correlations between the inputs and outputs. We are given inputs of four types: an integer in [0, 20], a float in [0.0, 20.0], a float in [0.0, 10.0], and a float in [0.0, 1.0].\n\n2. **Identify Key Factors**:\n   - The integer input often seems to act as a multiplier or scaling factor.\n   - The other floats seem to contribute additively or multiplicatively in some manner.\n   - A nonlinear transformation or conditional logic might be involved, especially given the varied nature of the outputs.\n\n3. **Test and Validate a Hypothesis**:\n   - Given the complexity and variability, it's likely that the function involves a combination of arithmetic operations (additions, multiplications) conditioned by the values of the inputs.\n\nLet's start by hypothesizing that the function might combine these inputs in a certain formula-like manner. \n\nFor instance, it may involve:\n- Using the first integer input as a scaling factor.\n- Combining the other inputs through some weighted sum or product.\n- Applying a non-linear transformation or conditional logic based on input values.\n\nWith this hypothesis in mind, here's a potential function implementation:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input1 == 0:\n        return input2\n    scale_factor = (input2 + input3) * input4\n    if scale_factor == 0:\n        return input1 * input3\n    result = (input1 * input2) / scale_factor + input3\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function attempts to capture some of the observed behaviors from the examples. However, it is important to note that without a clear pattern or more examples to confirm this logic, this implementation might not perfectly replicate the intended behavior. The function should be tested against the given examples to ensure its accuracy and make adjustments as necessary."}
