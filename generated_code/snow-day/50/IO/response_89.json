Our goal is to determine the underlying mechanism or formula used to calculate the output based on the inputs.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- `input1` is an integer in [0, 20],\n- `input2` is a float in [0.0, 20.0],\n- `input3` is a float in [0.0, 10.0],\n- `input4` is a float in [0.0, 1.0].\n\nThe examples seem to suggest a pattern or calculation method. Let's try to derive a formula that matches these outputs by looking at the examples:\n\n1. The presence of `input1` as a parameter suggests it might be used as a multiplier or a switch in some cases.\n2. The output seems to be affected by combinations of `input2`, `input3`, and `input4`.\n\nLet's hypothesize a formula and refine it based on the examples:\n\n1. When `input1` is large (near 20), the result is often a product of `input1`, `input2`, and `input3`.\n2. When `input1` is small, `input2` seems to have a more direct influence on the result.\n3. The presence of `input4` seems to introduce a non-linear effect or scaling factor.\n\nWe'll start with a hypothesis that when `input1` is 0, the result is simply `input2`, and when `input1` is 20, the result is some weighted function of all inputs. We'll use these observations to infer a formula:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input1 == 0:\n        return input2\n    if input1 == 20 and input4 == 0:\n        return input1 * input2 + input3\n    if input1 == 20 and input4 != 0:\n        return (input2 * input3) / input4\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input1 + input2\n    result = (input1 * input2 + input3) * (1 - input4) + (input3 * input4)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function uses a mix of conditions and operations to match the behavior observed in the examples. The key components are:\n- Direct return of `input2` when `input1` is 0.\n- A formula that scales and combines the inputs based on their values and `input4`, which acts as a scaling factor.\n\nThis approach should replicate the behavior for the given examples and can be adjusted further with more insights or test cases."}
