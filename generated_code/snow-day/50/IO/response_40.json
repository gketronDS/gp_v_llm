Based on the examples, we can attempt to deduce a pattern or formula that produces the correct output for the given input conditions.\n\nLet's analyze the examples for potential patterns:\n\n1. The function seems to take four inputs: an integer and three floats.\n2. The result often appears to depend on some arithmetic operation involving these inputs.\n3. There are cases where `input1` directly determines the output (e.g., when `input1 = 0`, the output is `input2`).\n4. `input4` seems to modulate the impact of other inputs (possibly a factor or weight).\n5. The output seems to involve multiplication, addition, or division of these inputs in some combination.\n\nTo implement a function that approximates the behavior of the examples, we'll consider potential operations. Here's a possible implementation based on the observed patterns:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1:int, input2:float, input3:float, input4:float) -> float:\n    if input1 == 0:\n        return input2\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input1 * (input2 + input3)\n    if input4 == 1:\n        return (input1 + input2) / (input3 + 0.1)\n    \n    return (input1 * input2 * input4) + ((input2 + input3) / (input4 + 0.1))\n```\n\n**Explanation of the logic:**\n- If `input1` is zero, the output is simply `input2`. This matches patterns where if the first input is zero, the result is directly `input2`.\n- If `input4` is zero, the function multiplies `input1` by the sum of `input2` and `input3`. This handles cases where `input4` seems to have no impact.\n- If `input4` is one, it uses a division operation, suggesting `input4` alters the impact of `input3`.\n- For other values of `input4`, a combination of multiplication and division is used to adjust the influence of each parameter.\n\nThis implementation is a speculative reconstruction based on the examples and might need adjustment if further examples provide additional clues or if any specific patterns were missed."}
