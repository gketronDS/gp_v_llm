Let's analyze the examples to identify a pattern or relation:\n\n1. **Example Analysis**:\n   - The output seems to be influenced by all four inputs, but not in a straightforward additive or multiplicative manner.\n   - The function seems to perform differently depending on the input values, especially the first integer input.\n   - It appears that the values of the outputs are not simply a result of the inputs being added, subtracted, or multiplied in a straightforward way.\n\nGiven the complexity and variety of inputs and outputs, it may be reasonable to assume the function involves some conditional logic or non-linear operations that result in different behaviors based on the ranges or specific values of the inputs.\n\n2. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to explore relationships between the inputs and the outputs.\n   - Consider operations like weighted combinations, divisions, and other arithmetic operations that might fit the patterns seen in the examples.\n   - Since the function is too complex to solve by a simple algebraic formula based on the examples alone, it is likely using some sort of conditional logic.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Implement a function that mimics the behavior of the examples, using base operations.\n   - Test the function against all examples to ensure it produces the correct outputs.\n\nHere's an attempt to define the function based on the observed patterns:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1:int, input2:float, input3:float, input4:float):\n    if input1 == 0:\n        return input2\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input1 * input2\n    result = (input2 + input3) / (input4 * input1)\n    if result > input1:\n        result += input3\n    if input1 > 10:\n        result *= (1 - input4)\n    return result\n\n# Note: This implementation is just a starting point based on a speculative pattern.\n# The actual function may require more sophisticated logic to match all examples.\n```\n\nThis is a hypothetical implementation to show how one might start modeling the behavior based on the examples. The actual underlying logic may differ significantly and would require further refinement by testing against the given examples or additional data."}
