We can observe the examples provided and try to deduce the underlying formula or operation.\n\nThe function takes four inputs:\n- `input1`: an integer in the range [0, 20]\n- `input2`: a float in the range [0.0, 20.0]\n- `input3`: a float in the range [0.0, 10.0]\n- `input4`: a float in the range [0.0, 1.0]\n\nLet's analyze the examples:\n\n1. One simple approach could be a weighted sum of the inputs, where each input is multiplied by some constant factor. However, this might not capture non-linear transformations or conditional behavior present in the examples.\n2. Another approach could involve conditional logic based on the ranges or specific values of the inputs.\n3. Given the wide variety of outputs and their apparent non-linear relationship with inputs, it's likely that a non-trivial combination of arithmetic operations is involved.\n\nLet's attempt to derive a formula based on the examples. By examining examples, it seems like there could be a pattern where the inputs are combined using specific arithmetic operations, potentially involving multiplication, addition, division, or other operations.\n\nHere's a plausible formula based on the examples:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input4 == 0.0:\n        return input1 * input2 + input3\n    else:\n        return (input1 + input2 * input3) / input4\n```\n\nThis formula is designed to capture the behavior of the examples provided. It distinguishes between cases where `input4` is zero and non-zero, applying different arithmetic operations accordingly. This formula may not precisely match every single example but offers a starting point to capture the behavior observed in the examples. Further refinement could be done by analyzing mismatches and adjusting the formula accordingly."}
