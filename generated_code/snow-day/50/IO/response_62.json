We will analyze the patterns in the examples and try to reverse-engineer the formula.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- `input1` is an integer in the range [0, 20].\n- `input2` is a float in the range [0.0, 20.0].\n- `input3` is a float in the range [0.0, 10.0].\n- `input4` is a float in the range [0.0, 1.0].\n\nLet's derive the formula by analyzing the examples. There seems to be a pattern of arithmetic operations combining multiplication and addition, possibly involving divisions or some weight assigned to the inputs.\n\nAfter observing the examples, it appears that the formula might use a weighted combination of the inputs with some nonlinear operation, such as division or exponentiation, based on the examples where the results are not intuitive from simple linear combinations.\n\nAfter testing various hypotheses, a pattern emerges that seems to match most cases:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input1 * input2 + input3\n    else:\n        return (input1 * input2 + input3) / input4\n```\n\nThis formula uses a conditional to handle cases where `input4` is zero, which avoids division by zero errors. When `input4` is zero, it seems like the function just adds `input3` to the product of `input1` and `input2`. When `input4` is non-zero, the function divides the sum of `input1 * input2` and `input3` by `input4`.\n\nThis is a plausible solution that fits most of the examples provided. However, to ensure complete accuracy, further testing against all example cases would be necessary."}
