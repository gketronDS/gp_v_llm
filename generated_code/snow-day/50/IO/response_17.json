The function should take four inputs: an integer in the range [0, 20], and three floats with specified ranges. The output should be a float.\n\nGiven the examples, we can make several observations:\n1. When the first argument (`input1`) is 0, the function returns `input2`.\n2. In cases where `input1` is non-zero, the output seems to be influenced by all four inputs in a way that involves some arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's try to deduce a pattern or formula that satisfies all the given examples by examining the relationships between the inputs and outputs. We'll attempt to identify operations involving multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction that align with the provided examples.\n\nHere's a function that implements a formula based on observed patterns from the examples:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input1 == 0:\n        return input2\n    return input2 * (1 - input4) + (input3 * input1) / (1 + input4 * input1)\n```\n\nThis function:\n- Returns `input2` directly if `input1` is 0, as observed in the examples.\n- For non-zero `input1`, computes a value influenced by the interactions of `input1`, `input2`, `input3`, and `input4` through a formula involving arithmetic operations. This formula was derived to match the pattern seen in the examples as closely as possible.\n\nThis solution is crafted to meet the examples provided and may not generalize to all possible inputs within the specified ranges."}
