Given the examples, let's attempt to deduce this pattern.\n\n1. The function takes four arguments:\n   - `input1`: an integer in the range [0, 20]\n   - `input2`: a float in the range [0.0, 20.0]\n   - `input3`: a float in the range [0.0, 10.0]\n   - `input4`: a float in the range [0.0, 1.0]\n\n2. The output is a float.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, there appears to be a mix of additive, multiplicative, and possibly conditional logic involved. Let's attempt to derive a formula based on the given examples and apply it to all cases:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: int, input2: float, input3: float, input4: float) -> float:\n    if input4 == 0:\n        return input1 * input2 + input3\n    elif input4 == 1:\n        return input3 / (input2 + 0.0001)\n    else:\n        return (input1 * input2 + input3) * (1 - input4) + (input1 + input3) * input4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **When `input4` is 0**: We assume a straightforward computation: `input1 * input2 + input3`. This would match cases where the output seems to be a simple multiplication of certain inputs.\n- **When `input4` is 1**: In cases where `input4` is at its maximum, the result seems to be influenced heavily by `input3` divided by something related to `input2`. We add a small value to `input2` to avoid division by zero.\n- **For other values of `input4`**: We use a blend of the results from above, where `input4` acts as a weight.\n\nThis pattern is a simple attempt to capture the behavior. It might not perfectly match all examples due to the complexity of the underlying mechanism, but it serves as a starting point based on the given constraints and examples."}
