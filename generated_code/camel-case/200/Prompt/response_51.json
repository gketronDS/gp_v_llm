This function will check the length of the input string and process it according to the rules described.\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str):\n    if not (1 <= len(input1) <= 20):\n        return \"\"\n    \n    def convert_to_camel_case(kebab_string):\n        parts = kebab_string.split('-')\n        return parts[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in parts[1:])\n    \n    groups = input1.split(' ')\n    result = ' '.join(convert_to_camel_case(group) for group in groups)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function performs the following steps:\n\n1. It checks if the length of the input string is between 1 and 20. If not, it returns an empty string.\n2. It defines a helper function `convert_to_camel_case` that takes a kebab-case string, splits it by '-', and converts it into camelCase.\n3. It splits the input string by spaces to separate the different groups.\n4. It applies the `convert_to_camel_case` function to each group and joins the results with spaces.\n5. It returns the final camelCase string."}
