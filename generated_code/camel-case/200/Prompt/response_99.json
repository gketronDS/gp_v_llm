Below is a Python function `my_func` that takes a string in kebab-case format, converts each grouping separated by spaces into camelCase, and ensures the input string length is between 1 and 20:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str):\n    if not 1 <= len(input1) <= 20:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    def to_camel_case(kebab: str) -> str:\n        parts = kebab.split('-')\n        return parts[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in parts[1:])\n    \n    return ' '.join(to_camel_case(group) for group in input1.split(' '))\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input string's length is between 1 and 20. If not, it returns an empty string. Then, for each group separated by spaces, it converts the kebab-case to camelCase using the `to_camel_case` function and joins the results with spaces."}
