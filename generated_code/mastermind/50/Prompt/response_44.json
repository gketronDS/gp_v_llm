It calculates the number of black pegs (correct color in the correct place) and white pegs (correct color in the wrong place) for the given inputs:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1: str, input2: str):\n    black_pegs = sum(a == b for a, b in zip(input1, input2))\n    white_pegs = 0\n    input1_counts = {}\n    input2_counts = {}\n\n    for char in input1:\n        if char in input1_counts:\n            input1_counts[char] += 1\n        else:\n            input1_counts[char] = 1\n\n    for i, char in enumerate(input2):\n        if input1[i] != char:\n            if char in input2_counts:\n                input2_counts[char] += 1\n            else:\n                input2_counts[char] = 1\n\n    for char, count in input2_counts.items():\n        if char in input1_counts:\n            white_pegs += min(input1_counts[char], count)\n\n    return black_pegs, white_pegs\n```\n\nThis function first calculates the number of black pegs by checking positions where the characters match between the two strings. Then, it calculates the potential white pegs by counting occurrences of each character in both strings, excluding positions where the characters are already matched as black pegs, and finally determining the minimum count for potential matches."}
