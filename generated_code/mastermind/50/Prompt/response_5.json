This gives the total number of correct colors irrespective of position.\n\n4. **White Pegs Calculation**:\n   - Subtract the number of black pegs from total matches to get the number of white pegs.\n\nThis function will correctly return the number of black and white pegs based on the rules of Mastermind."}
