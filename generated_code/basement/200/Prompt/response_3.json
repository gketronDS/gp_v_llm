As soon as the sum becomes negative, we return the current index. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a vector of integers, return the first index such that the sum of all integers from the start \n    of the vector to that index inclusive is negative.\n    \n    The function accepts inputs containing a vector of integers of length [1, 20] with each integer \n    in [-100, 100]. The function outputs an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    running_sum = 0\n    \n    for index, value in enumerate(input1):\n        running_sum += value\n        if running_sum < 0:\n            return index\n    \n    # If no index is found where the sum is negative, return -1 or any appropriate value\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nvector = [1, 2, -5, 1, -3]\nprint(my_func(vector))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We initialize `running_sum` to 0.\n- We iterate over each integer in the input vector using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value.\n- We add each integer to `running_sum`.\n- If `running_sum` becomes negative, we immediately return the current index.\n- If the loop completes without finding a negative sum, we return `-1` to indicate no such index exists. This behavior can be adjusted based on specific requirements."}
