The function will iterate through the vector of integers, maintaining a running sum, and return the first index where the sum becomes negative. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a vector of integers, return the first index such that the sum of all integers\n    from the start of the vector to that index inclusive is negative.\n    The input vector is assumed to have a length of [1, 20] with each integer in [-100, 100].\n    \"\"\"\n    running_sum = 0\n    for index, value in enumerate(input1):\n        running_sum += value\n        if running_sum < 0:\n            return index\n    # Return None if no such index is found, though per the problem statement,\n    # it seems there will always be such an index.\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\n# vector = [10, -20, 5, -10]\n# print(my_func(vector))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We start with a `running_sum` initialized to zero.\n- **Iteration**: We iterate over the vector using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value of each element.\n- **Running Sum Calculation**: For each element, we add its value to the `running_sum`.\n- **Negative Sum Check**: If at any point the `running_sum` becomes negative, we return the current index.\n- **Return Condition**: If no negative sum is found, the function returns `None`. However, based on the problem statement, it seems there will always be a negative sum with valid input, given the constraints.\n\nThis function is designed to handle inputs within the specified constraints efficiently without importing unnecessary packages."}
