{"submission": "```python\nGiven a vector of integers return the first index such that the sum of all integers from the start of the vector to that index inclusive is negative\ndef my_func(input1): \n                \"\"\"Alter this python function \"my_func\" to accept inputs containing             a vector of integers of length [1, 20] with each integer in [\u2212100, 100]. The function should output an integer. Do not import packages other than             numpy or math.\n             \"\"\"\n```", "response": "To modify the function `my_func` to achieve the desired behavior, we need to iterate over the elements of the input vector and calculate the cumulative sum. We'll return the first index where this cumulative sum becomes negative. Here's how the function can be implemented:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(input1):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function accepts a vector of integers (list) with a length between 1 and 20,\n    where each integer is between -100 and 100. It returns the first index such that\n    the cumulative sum of integers from the start of the vector to that index inclusive\n    is negative. If no such index exists, return None.\n    \"\"\"\n    cumulative_sum = 0\n    for index, value in enumerate(input1):\n        cumulative_sum += value\n        if cumulative_sum < 0:\n            return index\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_vector = [10, -20, 5, -30]\n# result = my_func(input_vector)\n# print(result)  # Output will be 1 since 10 + (-20) = -10 which is negative\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize `cumulative_sum`:** This variable will hold the running total of the elements as we iterate through the vector.\n   \n2. **Loop through the vector:** We use `enumerate` to get both the index and the value of each element in the list.\n\n3. **Calculate Cumulative Sum:** For each element, add its value to `cumulative_sum`.\n\n4. **Check for Negative Cumulative Sum:** If `cumulative_sum` becomes negative, return the current index.\n\n5. **Return None if No Negative Sum:** If no negative cumulative sum is found by the end of the loop, return `None`.\n\nThis function will efficiently find and return the first index where the cumulative sum becomes negative or indicate that no such index exists by returning `None`."}
